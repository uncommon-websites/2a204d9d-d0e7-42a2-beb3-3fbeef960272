{"text":"Perfect! I've successfully updated the Features section on the home page with 6 features that highlight Sentra's unique value propositions and main features. The new features focus on:\n\n1. **System-wide awareness through trusted conversations** - Highlighting the voice-based AI approach\n2. **Early alerts before misalignment turns into rework** - Emphasizing proactive detection\n3. **AI that's trustworthy by design** - Showcasing the trust-first, no-surveillance approach\n4. **Works with the tools your team already uses** - Demonstrating integration capabilities\n5. **A living map of how your org really functions** - Explaining the continuous organizational mapping\n6. **Multi-agent intelligence for complex team environments** - Highlighting the sophisticated AI architecture\n\nEach feature description is concise (either 2 short sentences or 1 longer sentence) and focuses on benefits rather than just technical features. The title and subtitle have been updated to better reflect Sentra's positioning as a trust-first AI solution for organizational alignment.\n\nThe features emphasize Sentra's key differentiators:\n- Trust and transparency (no surveillance)\n- Proactive problem detection\n- Voice-based human interaction\n- Integration with existing workflows\n- Comprehensive organizational awareness\n- Sophisticated AI that respects privacy\n\nAll content uses proper sentence case capitalization and avoids banned words from the writing guide.","files":[],"reasoningDetails":[],"toolCalls":[],"toolResults":[],"finishReason":"stop","usage":{"promptTokens":76146,"completionTokens":1506,"totalTokens":77652},"warnings":[],"request":{},"response":{"id":"gen-1750698513-OQYWKXK5jTD8TGwDfFrQ","timestamp":"2025-06-23T17:08:41.308Z","modelId":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4","headers":{"access-control-allow-origin":"*","cf-aig-cache-status":"MISS","cf-aig-event-id":"b1d0584d-2e99-4f7b-833d-a0032f8f62be","cf-aig-log-id":"01JYEW6N2VNCZ9H6NJGJQ2NN7J","cf-aig-step":"0","cf-ray":"9545968c719766c3-AMS","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"application/json","date":"Mon, 23 Jun 2025 17:08:36 GMT","server":"cloudflare","set-cookie":"__cf_bm=y.4wLGczgSEtsqEPUKehEbzgN5DJ613f4YOmAIrDHeo-1750698516-1.0.1.1-Ywc_tRGwGeO.8ZdMphBbavStn_TfSw8sm9bs1JUF7RCClPTj31Ukv9BAKSCafcdVbOfD9lR8SMq8L5auuU9tkc9Cqya2mB1zNmzzYR0ZVYQ; path=/; expires=Mon, 23-Jun-25 17:38:36 GMT; domain=.gateway.ai.cloudflare.com; HttpOnly; Secure","transfer-encoding":"chunked","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x-clerk-auth-message":"Invalid JWT form.

It’s here to help them work better together.

It gives everyone a voice, maps the whole organization in real time, and helps teams course-correct early—without extra meetings or noise.\n\nfeatures designed for clarity, not surveillance\n\nsystem-wide awareness through trusted conversations  \nSentra talks directly with individuals across the company, gathering insights you’d never catch in a dashboard. That means real visibility into how teams are doing—and where support is needed—without performance tracking or micromanagement.\n\nearly alerts before misalignment turns into rework  \nSentra spots tension, duplicated effort, or team drift before they lead to churned code, abandoned features, or low morale. Leaders gain the chance to act early instead of reacting late.\n\nAI that's trustworthy by design  \nBuilt on a strict trust-first model, Sentra never monitors, logs keystrokes, or spies on productivity. Participation is always consent-based, data is aggregated, and patterns are surfaced to fix systems—not to single people out.\n\nworks with the tools your team already uses  \nSentra integrates with systems like Slack, Jira, and Calendar to understand work as it happens. This context powers more accurate insights and ensures Sentra works as an extension of your current workflows—not a replacement.\n\na living map of how your org really functions  \nThrough ongoing conversations and consent-based integrations, Sentra maintains a dynamic, real-time snapshot of how people, teams, and goals connect. It's like having a second brain that understands company structure as it evolves.\n\nmulti-agent intelligence for complex team environments  \nSentra doesn’t rely on simple sentiment scores. It uses advanced models to triangulate issues accurately and tell you who’s affected, what’s causing friction, and where to focus—no guesswork required.\n\nbuilt for fast-growing orgs that have outgrown status meetings\n\nSay less in meetings—accomplish more together  \nSentra helps teams stay aligned asynchronously by surfacing what matters across teams without needing constant calls or check-ins.\n\nprevent friction before it slows delivery  \nMissed context and undefined responsibilities create downstream problems. Sentra highlights these early so teams stay focused on execution—not retroactive cleanup.\n\ngives every employee a voice, not just executives  \nMisalignment starts when issues go unspoken. Sentra listens to contributors at every level and raises problems that wouldn’t otherwise make it into standups or reports.\n\nAI for alignment—not control\n\nSentra isn’t here to watch your team work. It’s here to help them work better together. Voice-first, human-centered, and rooted in trust, Sentra acts like a digital chief of staff who never burns out or misses nuance.\n\nready to see what true alignment feels like?\n\nSentra is currently in private beta. If your team has passed 100 people and alignment is starting to slip, we’d love to connect.\n\ncontact us: contact@sentra.app\n\nSentra is an AI co-pilot—not a replacement for humans. Alignment requires trust. Our AI is built on it."}],"finishReason":"tool-calls","usage":{"promptTokens":19607,"completionTokens":318,"totalTokens":19925},"warnings":[],"request":{},"response":{"id":"gen-1750698465-J19p4zbDKZLfSCO9mzab","timestamp":"2025-06-23T17:07:54.516Z","modelId":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4","headers":{"access-control-allow-origin":"*","cf-aig-cache-status":"MISS","cf-aig-event-id":"2765370a-a8ab-4278-b5e5-a5ab4639556e","cf-aig-log-id":"01JYEW55SRYK6FSA2VRMDJ1GGS","cf-aig-step":"0","cf-ray":"9545955ea0bf66c3-AMS","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"application/json","date":"Mon, 23 Jun 2025 17:07:48 GMT","server":"cloudflare","set-cookie":"__cf_bm=CmqJPpmbsFeNvIxRnJb9yJyDiFF4nfbYKFcmzaR6g60-1750698468-1.0.1.1-eJ47ZQ1Bq_W68pdLVIkDJn_b7OO_v1CdDCU8R989hKw8LnJgeX82zs0QLnBrmmhORemxRtWe0iLDC9SBwts0VTo8MyKJVhAEPLrP1CzPEQs; path=/; expires=Mon, 23-Jun-25 17:37:48 GMT; domain=.gateway.ai.cloudflare.com; HttpOnly; Secure","transfer-encoding":"chunked","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x-clerk-auth-message":"Invalid JWT form.

Participation is always consent-based, data is aggregated, and patterns are surfaced to fix systems—not to single people out.\n\nworks with the tools your team already uses  \nSentra integrates with systems like Slack, Jira, and Calendar to understand work as it happens. This context powers more accurate insights and ensures Sentra works as an extension of your current workflows—not a replacement.\n\na living map of how your org really functions  \nThrough ongoing conversations and consent-based integrations, Sentra maintains a dynamic, real-time snapshot of how people, teams, and goals connect. It's like having a second brain that understands company structure as it evolves.\n\nmulti-agent intelligence for complex team environments  \nSentra doesn’t rely on simple sentiment scores. It uses advanced models to triangulate issues accurately and tell you who’s affected, what’s causing friction, and where to focus—no guesswork required.\n\nbuilt for fast-growing orgs that have outgrown status meetings\n\nSay less in meetings—accomplish more together  \nSentra helps teams stay aligned asynchronously by surfacing what matters across teams without needing constant calls or check-ins.\n\nprevent friction before it slows delivery  \nMissed context and undefined responsibilities create downstream problems. Sentra highlights these early so teams stay focused on execution—not retroactive cleanup.\n\ngives every employee a voice, not just executives  \nMisalignment starts when issues go unspoken.
