Important product updates go unnoticed. Priorities shift without full context. Meetings multiply, but clarity never improves.\n\nSentra exists to fix that.\n\nHuman-first AI that actually helps\n\nSentra isn’t a dashboard or a surveillance tool. It’s a conversational AI teammate that speaks with every level of your organization, every week. It listens. It empathizes. And it makes sure everyone is working toward the same goals — not crossing wires in siloed confusion.\n\n- Identifies where alignment is breaking down — and why\n- Alerts the right leaders early enough to act\n- Uses voice to speak naturally with your teams, not spam them with forms\n- Integrates with your tools (Slack, Jira, calendar, HRIS) to stay grounded in reality\n- Consensual by design — never surveillance or productivity tracking\n\nUse Sentra to spot cracks before they collapse your roadmap\n\nNo more building deprecated features. No more duplicated work. No more spending six weeks chasing an outdated priority. Sentra helps leaders call timeout early — before risk compounds.\n\nIt’s not your job to know everything. It’s Sentra’s.\n\nWhile standups and dashboards only give you scripted slices of reality, Sentra creates a high-resolution view of how your entire org is working together — in real time.\n\nThere’s no other teammate with this level of awareness. And no other tool designed to connect the dots for you before problems grow.\n\nBuilt for trust and designed for scale\n\n- No tap-ins without consent\n- Semi-anonymous reporting — systemic issues, not personal performance\n- No keystroke tracking, no mouse watching, ever\n\nRespect and alignment are not mutually exclusive. Sentra is designed from the ground up to support both.\n\nNow in private beta\n\nSentra is currently helping pilot customers reduce meeting bloat, resolve hidden misalignment faster, and get crucial time back. If you're a Series A+ company feeling the growing pains of scale — we're building this for you.\n\nJoin the beta → contact@sentra.app\n\nWhat early users say\n\n\"Sentra flagged a misaligned initiative before we hired the wrong team. That single insight saved us months and nearly $200,000.\"  \n— Safiya Green, CTO, Zentrolytics\n\n\"We’ve cut 9 hours of recurring meetings per week since implementing Sentra. It has more context than any one of us and shows up every time.\"  \n— Jarek Molina, VP Operations, Fusebeam\n\n\"Sentra picked up on overlaps between product and sales that were quietly derailing both teams. Catching it early changed our quarter.\"  \n— Emilie Takano, Head of Strategy, Dovetail Core"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Now let me generate images for each of the three testimonial customers, being careful about gender consistency with their names:"},{"type":"tool-call","toolCallId":"toolu_vrtx_01NVgp8UboGj18rH6UuVQTQ7","toolName":"generate_images","args":{"images":[{"aspectRatio":"3:4","prompt":"Professional Black woman tech executive in modern office environment"},{"aspectRatio":"3:4","prompt":"Professional Latino man operations leader in collaborative workspace"},{"aspectRatio":"3:4","prompt":"Professional Asian woman strategy executive in contemporary boardroom"}]}}],"id":"msg-jjB3g9SrDqontbXqpuaT3i3L"},{"role":"tool","id":"msg-MCCiKs4OllCHQbNxZ7VOHCvd","content":[{"type":"tool-result","toolCallId":"toolu_vrtx_01NVgp8UboGj18rH6UuVQTQ7","toolName":"generate_images","result":"Image generation summary:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage #1:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- prompt: A professional Black woman executive in a modern office environment, surrounded by colleagues engaged in conversation and collaboration.

Important product updates go unnoticed. Priorities shift without full context. Meetings multiply, but clarity never improves.\n\nSentra exists to fix that.\n\nHuman-first AI that actually helps\n\nSentra isn’t a dashboard or a surveillance tool. It’s a conversational AI teammate that speaks with every level of your organization, every week. It listens. It empathizes. And it makes sure everyone is working toward the same goals — not crossing wires in siloed confusion.\n\n- Identifies where alignment is breaking down — and why\n- Alerts the right leaders early enough to act\n- Uses voice to speak naturally with your teams, not spam them with forms\n- Integrates with your tools (Slack, Jira, calendar, HRIS) to stay grounded in reality\n- Consensual by design — never surveillance or productivity tracking\n\nUse Sentra to spot cracks before they collapse your roadmap\n\nNo more building deprecated features. No more duplicated work. No more spending six weeks chasing an outdated priority. Sentra helps leaders call timeout early — before risk compounds.\n\nIt’s not your job to know everything. It’s Sentra’s.\n\nWhile standups and dashboards only give you scripted slices of reality, Sentra creates a high-resolution view of how your entire org is working together — in real time.\n\nThere’s no other teammate with this level of awareness. And no other tool designed to connect the dots for you before problems grow.\n\nBuilt for trust and designed for scale\n\n- No tap-ins without consent\n- Semi-anonymous reporting — systemic issues, not personal performance\n- No keystroke tracking, no mouse watching, ever\n\nRespect and alignment are not mutually exclusive. Sentra is designed from the ground up to support both.\n\nNow in private beta\n\nSentra is currently helping pilot customers reduce meeting bloat, resolve hidden misalignment faster, and get crucial time back. If you're a Series A+ company feeling the growing pains of scale — we're building this for you.\n\nJoin the beta → contact@sentra.app\n\nWhat early users say\n\n\"Sentra flagged a misaligned initiative before we hired the wrong team. That single insight saved us months and nearly $200,000.\"  \n— Safiya Green, CTO, Zentrolytics\n\n\"We’ve cut 9 hours of recurring meetings per week since implementing Sentra. It has more context than any one of us and shows up every time.\"  \n— Jarek Molina, VP Operations, Fusebeam\n\n\"Sentra picked up on overlaps between product and sales that were quietly derailing both teams. Catching it early changed our quarter.\"  \n— Emilie Takano, Head of Strategy, Dovetail Core"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Now let me generate images for each of the three testimonial customers, being careful about gender consistency with their names:"},{"type":"tool-call","toolCallId":"toolu_vrtx_01NVgp8UboGj18rH6UuVQTQ7","toolName":"generate_images","args":{"images":[{"aspectRatio":"3:4","prompt":"Professional Black woman tech executive in modern office environment"},{"aspectRatio":"3:4","prompt":"Professional Latino man operations leader in collaborative workspace"},{"aspectRatio":"3:4","prompt":"Professional Asian woman strategy executive in contemporary boardroom"}]}}],"id":"msg-jjB3g9SrDqontbXqpuaT3i3L"},{"role":"tool","id":"msg-MCCiKs4OllCHQbNxZ7VOHCvd","content":[{"type":"tool-result","toolCallId":"toolu_vrtx_01NVgp8UboGj18rH6UuVQTQ7","toolName":"generate_images","result":"Image generation summary:\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tImage #1:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- prompt: A professional Black woman executive in a modern office environment, surrounded by colleagues engaged in conversation and collaboration.

Important product updates go unnoticed. Priorities shift without full context. Meetings multiply, but clarity never improves.\n\nSentra exists to fix that.\n\nHuman-first AI that actually helps\n\nSentra isn’t a dashboard or a surveillance tool. It’s a conversational AI teammate that speaks with every level of your organization, every week. It listens. It empathizes. And it makes sure everyone is working toward the same goals — not crossing wires in siloed confusion.\n\n- Identifies where alignment is breaking down — and why\n- Alerts the right leaders early enough to act\n- Uses voice to speak naturally with your teams, not spam them with forms\n- Integrates with your tools (Slack, Jira, calendar, HRIS) to stay grounded in reality\n- Consensual by design — never surveillance or productivity tracking\n\nUse Sentra to spot cracks before they collapse your roadmap\n\nNo more building deprecated features. No more duplicated work. No more spending six weeks chasing an outdated priority. Sentra helps leaders call timeout early — before risk compounds.\n\nIt’s not your job to know everything. It’s Sentra’s.\n\nWhile standups and dashboards only give you scripted slices of reality, Sentra creates a high-resolution view of how your entire org is working together — in real time.\n\nThere’s no other teammate with this level of awareness. And no other tool designed to connect the dots for you before problems grow.\n\nBuilt for trust and designed for scale\n\n- No tap-ins without consent\n- Semi-anonymous reporting — systemic issues, not personal performance\n- No keystroke tracking, no mouse watching, ever\n\nRespect and alignment are not mutually exclusive. Sentra is designed from the ground up to support both.\n\nNow in private beta\n\nSentra is currently helping pilot customers reduce meeting bloat, resolve hidden misalignment faster, and get crucial time back. If you're a Series A+ company feeling the growing pains of scale — we're building this for you.\n\nJoin the beta → contact@sentra.app\n\nWhat early users say\n\n\"Sentra flagged a misaligned initiative before we hired the wrong team.

Important product updates go unnoticed. Priorities shift without full context. Meetings multiply, but clarity never improves.\n\nSentra exists to fix that.\n\nHuman-first AI that actually helps\n\nSentra isn’t a dashboard or a surveillance tool. It’s a conversational AI teammate that speaks with every level of your organization, every week. It listens. It empathizes. And it makes sure everyone is working toward the same goals — not crossing wires in siloed confusion.\n\n- Identifies where alignment is breaking down — and why\n- Alerts the right leaders early enough to act\n- Uses voice to speak naturally with your teams, not spam them with forms\n- Integrates with your tools (Slack, Jira, calendar, HRIS) to stay grounded in reality\n- Consensual by design — never surveillance or productivity tracking\n\nUse Sentra to spot cracks before they collapse your roadmap\n\nNo more building deprecated features. No more duplicated work. No more spending six weeks chasing an outdated priority. Sentra helps leaders call timeout early — before risk compounds.\n\nIt’s not your job to know everything. It’s Sentra’s.\n\nWhile standups and dashboards only give you scripted slices of reality, Sentra creates a high-resolution view of how your entire org is working together — in real time.\n\nThere’s no other teammate with this level of awareness. And no other tool designed to connect the dots for you before problems grow.\n\nBuilt for trust and designed for scale\n\n- No tap-ins without consent\n- Semi-anonymous reporting — systemic issues, not personal performance\n- No keystroke tracking, no mouse watching, ever\n\nRespect and alignment are not mutually exclusive. Sentra is designed from the ground up to support both.\n\nNow in private beta\n\nSentra is currently helping pilot customers reduce meeting bloat, resolve hidden misalignment faster, and get crucial time back. If you're a Series A+ company feeling the growing pains of scale — we're building this for you.\n\nJoin the beta → contact@sentra.app\n\nWhat early users say\n\n\"Sentra flagged a misaligned initiative before we hired the wrong team.
