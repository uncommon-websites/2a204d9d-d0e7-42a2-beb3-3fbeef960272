		"We saw it happening everywhere: growing organizations struggling with misalignment that was costing them millions. Conflicting priorities, duplicated effort, canceled projects no one knew about, teams building deprecated features. The pain was real, but the solutions weren't working.",
		"Every company's response was the same—add more meetings, create more dashboards, install more surveillance tools. But these 'fixes' were making things worse, not better. They created silos, encouraged performative reporting, and eroded the trust that real alignment requires.",
		"That's when we realized the world needed something fundamentally different: an AI teammate that continuously senses organizational misalignment and alerts leaders before problems spiral. Not through surveillance, but through trust. Not with dashboards, but with voice. Sentra is what we built—the first autonomous organizational intelligence that keeps everyone moving together."
